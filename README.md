# Butcher's Circus (BCPL)

My first website and major project (Jan 2022 – Jan 2023): A community platform for tracking tournament standings in a Darkest Dungeon-inspired gaming league.

Features included:
- User login/register
- Leaderboards with points, games played, k/d ratios
- Fixtures/results submission & display
- Player stats, meta builds, news articles with quotes

Built with: Vanilla JavaScript, PHP (backend/logic), SQL (data), CSS + Bootstrap.

No Git was used during development → code is messy, monolithic (all files in root), and needs refactoring. Proud of completing a full functional app from scratch over 6-8 months of self-learning.
